            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.We are by heart dedicated to it.</p>

However it's expected to grow as the CBSE has brought changes in its education system which emphasises inclusion of certain number and types of vocational subjects in classes 9th and 11th. Although it's not mandatory for schools to go for it but a good number of schools have voluntarily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the change in their curriculum.</p>

A literate person can free a country from prison of social evils. Let's be together in this fight to carve out all social and economic issues out of India. The focus on a limited number of skills also may lead to dividing the curriculum into “core” subjects and other subjects that consequently may or may not be important. Sahlberg (2011) comments that international tests “focus on areas too narrow to capture the whole spectrum of school education, and thus ignore social skills, moral development, creativity, or digital literacy as important outcomes of public education”</p>
